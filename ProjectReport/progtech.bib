  abstract = {The question of how to measure and classify people’s risk preferences is of substantial importance in the field of economics. Inspired by the multitude of ways used to elicit risk preferences, we conduct a holistic investigation of the most prevalent method, the multiple price list (MPL) and its derivations. In our experiment, we find that revealed preferences differ under various versions of MPLs as well as yield unstable results within a 30-minute time frame. We determine the most stable elicitation method with the highest forecast accuracy by using multiple measures of within-method consistency and by using behavior in two economically relevant games as benchmarks. A derivation of the well-known method by Holt and Laury (American Economic Review 92(5):1644–1655, ), where the highest payoff is varied instead of probabilities, emerges as the best MPL method in both dimensions. As we pinpoint each MPL characteristic’s effect on the revealed preference and its consistency, our results have implications for preference elicitation procedures in general.},

Choosing which to utilize, however, is largely dependent on the question one wants to answer, as well as the characteristics of the sample population. The goal of this paper is to present a series of prevailing methods for eliciting risk preferences and outline the advantages and disadvantages of each. We do not attempt to give a comprehensive account of all the methods or nuances of measuring risk, but rather to outline some advantages and disadvantages of different methods.},

  abstract = {Multiple price lists have emerged as a simple and popular method for eliciting risk preferences. Despite their popularity, a key downside of multiple price lists has not been widely recognized — namely that the approach is unlikely to generate sufficient information to accurately identify different dimensions of risk preferences. The most popular theories of decision making under risk posit that preferences for risk are driven by a combination of two factors: the curvature of the utility function and the extent to which probabilities are weighted non-linearly. In this paper, we show that the widely used multiple price list introduced by Holt and Laury (The American Economic Review 92(5) 1644–1655 2002) is likely more accurate at eliciting the shape of the probability weighting function, and we construct a different multiple price list that is likely more accurate at eliciting the shape of the utility function. We show that by combining information from different multiple price lists, greater predictive performance can be achieved.},

This paper presents ready-to-use software applications for widely used choice list methodologies for use with oTree, including (i) multiple price lists, (ii) certainty equivalent tests, (iii) staircase methods, and (iv) single choice lists. The parameterization and configuration of different features of a task are administered by specifying predefined variables in a single, thoroughly documented file. All apps feature responsive graphical designs, are prepared for multilingual use, and include predefined “bots” for automated testing. By this means, each task can be implemented in the laboratory, the field, or online within only a few minutes.},
